# powerbi_engeto
This is my first Power BI project. I chose the topic for my work about Sleep Health. I was trying to find some open scientific data on this theme, but I didnâ€™t find any, so in the end, I used data just for illustration purposes. In the PBIX file, you can find all the information you need, for example, the source of the dataset, and of course, all the data I used.
I hope you enjoy my work :)
